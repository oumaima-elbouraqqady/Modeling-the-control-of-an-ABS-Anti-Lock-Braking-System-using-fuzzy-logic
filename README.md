# Modeling-the-control-of-an-ABS-Anti-Lock-Braking-System-using-fuzzy-logic
This repository contains the modeling and simulation of an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) using MATLAB/Simulink. The project implements and compares two control strategies: a PID regulator and a fuzzy logic controller. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and stability of the fuzzy logic controller, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.

Through this project, key skills in system modeling, simulation, and control design using fuzzy logic were developed. The repository provides a comprehensive approach to understanding ABS functionality and evaluating control strategies for enhanced braking performance.

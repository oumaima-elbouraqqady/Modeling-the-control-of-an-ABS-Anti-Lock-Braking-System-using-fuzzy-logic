# Modeling-the-control-of-an-ABS-Anti-Lock-Braking-System-using-fuzzy-logic
This repository features the modeling and simulation of an ABS using MATLAB/Simulink. It compares PID and fuzzy logic controllers, highlighting the superior performance and stability of the fuzzy logic approach. This project demonstrates key skills in system modeling, simulation, and control design.
